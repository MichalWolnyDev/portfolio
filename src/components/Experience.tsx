                Since the beginning of 2019, I have been working full-time at <a href="https://webwizards.pl/" target='_blank'>Webwizards</a>, a company located near Pozna≈Ñ. In this company, I had the opportunity to take my first steps as a frontend developer. My main responsibility is creating and developing websites for the automotive industry. I have also had the chance to work on the creation of car sales portals (such as <a href="https://www.plichta.com.pl/" target='_blank'>https://www.plichta.com.pl/</a>). Working at this company has allowed me to familiarize myself with the specifics of being a frontend developer and has further developed both my technical and soft skills.
